                  As it is with many poverty-stricken countries, the movement 
                  toward women’s empowerment in Africa is just beginning. Many 
                  communities still abide by the traditional family roles of women
                   with three out of four households run by men. 
                   <br/>
                   <br/>
                   In this family 
                   structure, it is usually the responsibility of the women to care
                  for the family and provide all necessities, such as food, shelter
                     and clothing. An empowered woman would be able to meet the needs
                      of her family more efficiently and effectively.

                      With access

                  A significant disparity exists between the number of women working 
                  and owning Africa’s land. Only 15 percent of all landholders in sub-Saharan
                   Africa are women, but 80 percent of the food produced in Africa is grown
                    by women. Women also make up 74 percent of all workers in sub-Saharan 
                    Africa’s informal economy. These women work as street vendors and seasonal
                     agricultural workers, but they do not receive protection from government 
                     regulations such as labor laws, health insurance or fair wages. Only 
                     one-third of African women are active in the formal economy.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     <hr></hr>

                  As the percentage of educated women rises, so does the percentage of women
                   in the workforce. At 27 percent, the world’s highest number of women entrepreneurs
                    is in sub-Saharan Africa. In this respect the SICP Charity envisages on strenghtening
                    the Education for Women and Girls as a part of solutions by providing them the scholarships,
                    helping dropout girls to enroll in the vocational schools and teaching widows and women
                    to embark on the self employment status using our designed projects that can help them
                    to access decent incomes. With a dedicated heart to this initiative of SICP and the hands of our Donors
                    we believe that despite the gender gap appearing today, there are promising signs for 
                    women’s empowerment in Africa.

                   the incredible story of how an African nomad overcame considerable odds and
                    unspeakable traumas to become an international modeling sensation. 
                    The inspiring story of an extraordinary, proud and brave woman,

                   offers a gripping plea to stop
